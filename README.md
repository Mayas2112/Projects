### AVL Tree Implementation
Partnered to implement an AVL Tree, focusing on insertion, deletion, and search operations. 
This project honed our abilities in algorithmic efficiency and collaborative testing, deepening our understanding of balancing complexities in data structures.

### Hash Table Development with Lists
Collaboratively developed a dynamic array-based Hash Table using lists for collision handling, emphasizing adaptability and efficient data management. 
This effort enhanced our skills in data structure innovation and teamwork under technical challenges.

### Small Shell for Operating Systems
Together, we created a small shell, integrating basic commands, piping, `chmod`, and background process management.
This project sharpened our system programming skills, particularly in Unix system calls and process handling, showcasing effective collaborative problem-solving.

### Union Find Algorithm Application
Applied the Union Find algorithm to address connectivity problems, focusing on efficient ‘union’ and ‘find’ operations. 
This project was a practical demonstration of optimizing algorithms for large datasets, improving our collaborative approach to complex algorithmic solutions.
